    Hello guys !!

    Today i'm going to build my first ever project and im excited :)...

    The project will be like this, i'll use every element,attribute,values i learned through the curriculum about html, and try create something meaningful by expressing what are my goals,intention, and where i see my self later in future.

    things i'll learn from this is:
        
        -being familiar with most common html elements     
        -able to create without trying to remember html's boilerplate 
        -being familiar with git commands 
        -creating a repository using github 
        -how to use terminal like the basics from navigating through directories and creating and deleting files and moving it anywhere 

    And once i reach to the end of this curriculum and go on my own i'll would like to teach and guide people who want to become web developers.

    And last but not least i hope it goes alright from the first try and without forgetting something like attribute or value etc.. (guy's pls i need y'all support ); !!!).
